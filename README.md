# Slim Slider
A very tiny slider made with CSS for placeholder complex sliders.

## Description.
This small code is focused to add a placeholder to your projects where you have not yet decided which slider or carousel of images you want to include.

Animated, so you can at least see how it will look like.

It is not a regular slider. The idea is to make it as light as possible in terms of lines of code.
